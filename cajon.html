				<h3>Meinl Percussion SUBCAJ5WN Cajon</h3>
				<p>With its internal reflex channel and front sound port in place of a traditional rear-facing one, the Meinl Percussion Jumbo
					 Subwoofer Cajon gives you enhanced bass note projection that's awesome for live and unplugged gigs. Fixed internal snare wires
					  serve up a crisp, cutting sound that enhances your corner slaps and adds a dash of contrast to bass notes. The Jumbo Bass Cajon
						 is designed to project huge, deep bass tones that swell when you play harder and respond much like a bass drum with a soft punch
						  behind quiet notes. At Sweetwater, we're really enjoying the Meinl Percussion Jumbo Subwoofer Cajon. You will, too.</p>

				<h3>Meinl Percussion HCAJ1NT Cajon</h3>
				<p>Meinl Percussion Headliner Cajon, Rubber Wood:
The MEINL Headliner Series Cajon delivers the classic cajon sound at an affordable price and can be used in Flamenco or world music.
It is also very useful during unplugged gigs for delivering the rhythmic foundation for a whole band when a full drum set can't be used.
 For more sound options, the top corners of the cajon can be adjusted, allowing the player to customize the amount of snap desired.</p>

				<h3>Latin Percussion Americana Groove Cajon</h3>
				<p>Carefully engineered and built by hand right here in the USA, the Latin Percussion Americana Groove Cajon has a wonderfully woody
					 tone with a snare-drum-like snap. The soundboard and body are hand-selected Baltic Birch wood - very beautiful, with incredible
					  resonance. The fixed snare wires and adjustable front plate give you an excellent blend of "boom" and "pop," making - it's perfect
						 for acoustic ensembles where a full drum kit would be out of place. So whether you're a flamenco fanatic or just looking for
						  unique percussion to add to your sound, you'll love the sound of the Latin Percussion Americana Groove Cajon.</p>
