          <h3>Yamaha Arius YDP-143 88-Key Digital Console Piano</h3>
          <p>The YDP-143 reminds me of a spinet sized piano, which makes it easy to move and doesn’t take up excess space. Weighing around 84
             pounds, you wouldn’t have the obstacles that are associated with moving an acoustic piano.
Whether you’re moving it into a new room, or to a new home for that matter, this model is the ideal size. If you are worried about space,
 it would go great along your living room or studio wall.
It is available in a rosewood or black walnut finish, giving it a more genuine wooden appearance. Furniture-styled pianos have always been
a great way to tie a room together, and the YDP-143 is no exception.</p>
