					<h3>Taylor Academy 12e</h3>
					<p>Taylor’s Academy Series makes the playing experience more accessible in every way, packing signature Taylor playing features
						 into an affordable package. With the Academy 12e, our compact Grand Concert body makes the perfect companion for fingerpicking
						 or anyone with a lighter touch who craves the physical comfort of a small-body guitar. The guitar’s design specs are optimized
						for playing ease. Taylor’s patented, slim-profile neck features an array of hand-friendly touches: a shorter 24-7/8-inch scale
						 length, 1-11/16-inch nut width, low action, and light gauge strings, all of which contribute to a slinky handfeel.
						The lightweight guitar body, featuring layered sapele back and sides with a solid Sitka spruce top, boasts an ergonomic
						 armrest that enhances the playing comfort for one’s picking arm. The guitar was also voiced to be extra responsive to
						 make the playing experience as relaxed as possible. The guitar comes with an onboard ES-B pickup that includes a built-in
						 digital chromatic tuner, and comes with a sturdy lightweight gig bag.</p>

						<h3>Seagull S6</h3>
						<p>Laminate wild cherry back and sides deliver a detailed tone between warm mahogany and bright maple. Modified dreadnought
							 body shape cuts unwanted boominess, making it great for recording and live shows. 1.8" nut width is great for players with
							 smaller hands.</p>

						<h3>Yamaha FG830 Dreadnought</h3>
						<p>Rich overtones and improved sustain thanks to the rosewood back and sides deliver improved sound through greater ‘depth’.
							 The appearance, with abalone inlay around the sound hole, is more luxurious and an obvious step-up.
							 Specially Developed Scalloped Bracing
							 Yamaha's modern FG has louder and stronger sound in the low- to mid-ranges, thanks to cutting-edge acoustic analysis technology developed
							 by the Yamaha R&D Division. Yamaha’s engineers have achieved this sound by utilizing analysis and simulation to arrive at the best bracing
							 design without depending on tradition or guesswork. This analysis led to the development of the new scalloped bracing pattern, an ideal
							 acoustic structure that maintains the durability of the top board while bringing out the most sound the Yamaha FG has to offer.</p>
